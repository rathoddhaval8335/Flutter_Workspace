Practical Question: 3

1. Prepare Your App
Update Version: Open pubspec.yaml and set your version:
version: 1.0.0+1
Remove Debug Code: Ensure there’s no debug code or print statements in your app.
Set App Icon: Use the flutter_launcher_icons package to generate an app icon:
Add this to pubspec.yaml:
dev_dependencies:
  flutter_launcher_icons: ^0.9.2
flutter_icons:
  android: true
  ios: true
  image_path: "assets/icon/app_icon.png"


Run:

flutter pub run flutter_launcher_icons:main

2. Build the APK or AAB 
To build the Android App Bundle (AAB) (recommended for Play Store):
flutter build appbundle

3. Create Google Play Developer Account
Go to Google Play Console
 and create a developer account (one-time fee of $25).

4. Create Play Store Listing
In Play Console, click on Create Application.
Add details like app name, description, screenshots, and a feature graphic.

5. Upload APK or AAB
In Production > Create Release, upload the generated .aab file from the build/app/outputs/bundle/release/ folder.

6. Set Pricing & Distribution
Choose whether the app is free or paid, and select the countries you want to distribute it in.

7. Submit for Review
Click Review and Rollout to send your app to Google for approval.

8. Wait for Approval
Google will review your app (typically 1-3 days), and once approved, it will be live on the Play Store.
